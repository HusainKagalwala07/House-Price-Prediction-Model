Machine Learning Model, for approximate prediction of a price of the house based on 13 features that are found in the datasets, which uses the parameters to determine the approximate price of the house to be sold for various parameters.

1.	 AGE - The proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

3.	RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
4.	TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

Technology and Libraries Used: 
Dataset: The Boston Housing Dataset
Libraries and Techniques used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn (used concept of Stratified Learning), Random Forest Regressor, joblib (for storing the copy of model)
